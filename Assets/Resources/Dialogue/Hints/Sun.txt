Otenko<n>Since time immemorial, those wielding the powers of Darkness have tried to establish dominance over our planet...
Otenko<n>The only way to defeat them is to use the power of the [Sun]...
Otenko<n>The bar on the lower right of the screen is called the [Light-Dark Meter] or [LD Meter] for short.
Otenko<n>It shows how much [Sunlight] is in the area.
Otenko<n>If you have [WeatherSync] enabled, the LD Meter will detect how much Sun you have based on local weather.
Otenko<n>Otherwise, Sunlight will be based off of time of day only.
