Otenko<n>When the [LD Meter] at the bottom of the screen turns red, that means you are standing under a [Shadow].
Otenko<n>The number of red bars indicates how strong the Shadow is.
Otenko<n>The more Sunlight that gets picked up by WeatherSync, the stronger the Shadows will become.
Otenko<n>Immortals and the Undead can draw power from the Darkness lingering in shadowy areas.
Otenko<n>Please, take caution.
