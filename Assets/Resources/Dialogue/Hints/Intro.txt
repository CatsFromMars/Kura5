Otenko<n>Salutations! I am [Otenko], Messenger of the Sun and Terrenial representative of the earth's consciousness.
Otenko<n>Long ago, an arduous series of battles between life and the forces of the Undead took place here.
Otenko<n>Injuries sustained from these battles forced me into a state of hibernation.
Otenko<n>I bound myself to these [Hint Panels] so that I may be able to guide future generations into finding their own Sun...
Otenko<n>You may summon me by walking up to a [Hint Panel] and pressing the [CHARGE BUTTON]
