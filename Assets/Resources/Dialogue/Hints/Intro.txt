Otenko<n>Thank you for activating this panel!
Otenko<n>Salutations! I am Master Otenko, Messenger of the Sun! 
Otenko<n>Long ago, an arduous series of battles between life and the forces of the Undead took place here.
Otenko<n>Injuries sustained from past battles forced me into a state of hibernation.
Otenko<n>I bound myself to these [Hint Panels] so that I may be able to guide future generations into following the path of the Sun.
Otenko<n>We are on the edge of an Undead Zone. Here you will need to make use of the Sun's power in order to defend yourself.
Otenko<n>The bar on the lower right of the screen shows how much [Sunlight] is in the area.
Otenko<n>If you have [WeatherSync] enabled, the LD Meter will detect how much Sun you have based on local weather.
Otenko<n>Otherwise, Sunlight will be based off of time of day only.
S=maythesunbewithyou
Otenko<n>May the Sun be with you!
