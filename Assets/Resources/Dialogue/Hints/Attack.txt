Otenko<n>The Undead may not be able to die, but they are not indestructable!
Otenko<n>Press the ^^ATTACK to fire a shot from a Solar Gun.
Otenko<n>Attacks from behind will give you a key advantage.
Otenko<n>But take caution! If your ENE Gauge in the corner of the screen runs out, you will be unable to fire a shot.
