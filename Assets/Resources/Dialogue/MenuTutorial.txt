WeatherSync gets local weather data using your IP Address.
For WeatherSync to work, make sure you have a stable internet connection.
If you lack access to the internet, WeatherSync will just use generic weather instead.
Local weather is used to measure the strength of light from both the Sun and the Moon.
Light, in turn, increases the strength of shadows.
This means you no longer have to go outside, but maybe you should anyway. Sunlight is good for you!
Weather affects the game world too. Depending on your play style, some days are better than others...
Be sure experiment to see what works best for you!
