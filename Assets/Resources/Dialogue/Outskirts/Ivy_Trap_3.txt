M=VampireEmil
Annie<n>You!
Annie<n>Had enough of trying to kill me!?
Annie<n>Cus when I get out of here you're next!
<CAM_GOTO_POINT=EmilNPC>
Mysterious Boy<n>If you hadn’t noticed, I was trying to HELP you!
Mysterious Boy<n>And even more, this is another Immortal’s place of power.
Mysterious Boy<n>It would be a waste of power to try to overpower her influence with my own just to lure you into a trap.
<A=EmilNPC_2>
Mysterious Boy<n>In short, not my dungeon, not my trap.
<A=EmilNPC_0>
<CAM_GOTO_POINT=PlayerPositionContainer>
Annie<n>Grr...Fine. If yer gunna run yer mouth, what the heck is this stuff?
<CAM_GOTO_POINT=LookIvy>
Mysterious Boy<n>Corrupted Solar Ivy.
Mysterious Boy<n>It takes an attack of the [Dark Property] to get rid of this menace.

Annie<n>Why are yer' helpin’ me?
<R=EMIL_1>
Mysterious Boy<n>NOW you ask.
<CLEAR_EMOJI=AnniePlayer>
<CLEAR_EMOJI=EmilNPC>
<A=EmilNPC_0>
<L=NULL_0>
<R=NULL_0>
Mysterious Boy<n>Because I require your help.
Annie<n>Help with what, gettin' yer next meal?
Mysterious Boy<n>I'm no savage.
##Fade in
<A=CutsceneFade_0>
Mysterious Boy<n>No. I need you to help me kill the Immortal, [La Lupe].
<E=AnniePlayer_1>
<PAUSE_FOR=1>
Annie<n>Kill one of yer own?
Mysterious Boy<n>Not all those of the Dark see eye to eye.
Mysterious Boy<n>Though, you could say I have deeper reasons to hold her in low regard.
Mysterious Boy<n>All to your benefit: you want to kill La Lupe? So do I.
##Emil turns into a bird

Mysterious Boy<n>Up until now, I've been watching you like this.
Mysterious Boy<n>And I see you've managed to come this far and not die. There is potential in your abilities.
<A=AnniePlayer_4>
Annie<n>All that sneaking around ain't helping yer case, tarfeathers!

<R=EMIL_4>
Mysterious Boy<n>Good, good. You are shrewd, wary. You have good reason to be fearful of me!
<R=EMIL_5>
<L=ANNIE_1>
Mysterious Boy<n>But you're missing the point!
<R=EMIL_2>
Mysterious Boy<n>Go in there as you are now, and you will likely be taken unawares by another trap, and find yourself in the arms of death before long.
<R=EMIL_1>
Mysterious Boy<n>Meanwhile, I alone cannot destroy La Lupe.
<R=EMIL_5>
Mysterious Boy<n>Without the Sun's power, she will merely use the [Dark Matter] to return even from Death.
<R=EMIL_2>
Mysterious Boy<n>If we combine our powers we put an end to a common foe. We can end her for good!
<R=EMIL_2>
Mysterious Boy<n>Work with me, and I will ensure that fury you hide behind that sunny face of yours will reach her.
<L=ANNIE_4>
Annie<n>Yer not seriously askin' me to trust a vamp that looks like Peter Pan's evil twin, aye?
<R=EMIL_1>
Mysterious Boy<n>No, I am asking you to work with me. Whether or not you trust me is irrelevant.
<R=EMIL_2>
Mysterious Boy<n>You may not trust me, but you may trust your gun should I fail to hold up my end of the bargain.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>Hm...
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>(I'm not gunna be able to shake him off, huh?)
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>...If I see ya getting up to any vampire funny business, you'll be seein' the business end of this Solar Gun.
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>Got a name, Vamp?
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>I am [Emil].
<L=NULL_0>
<R=NULL_0>
Annie<n>Well, Emil...
<A=AnniePlayer_7>
Annie<n>Call me [Annie].
Annie<n>Guess we're partners, huh?
<A=EmilNPC_9>
Emil<n>In all but gesture, I suppose.
<A=EmilNPC_0>
Annie<n>I knew Vampires were cold-blooded, but not that cold.
<A=AnniePlayer_0>
Emil<n>I see you can make wisecracks as well.
Emil<n>Shall we continue on?
<A=EmilNPC_2>
Emil<n>I imagine you'll want to eliminate the Immortal while your heart still beats.
