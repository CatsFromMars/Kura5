Woman in Purple<n>You think you're clever, don't you?
Woman in Purple<n>Using a sneak attack to strike me. 
Woman in Purple<n>If nothing else, you are more practical than your comrades who 'valiantly' died attempting the same thing. 
Woman in Purple<n>But did you think that alone would be enough to defeat me?

Woman in Purple<n>Fool!
Woman in Purple<n>You are still just a human, weak and fragile, and I am [Immortal!]

<A=LaLupe_0>
La lupe<n>Insolent child. To think you could harm [La Lupe!]
<R=LUPE_1>
La lupe<n>But still, I let my guard down. I was weak enough to allow something like you to maim me.
<R=LUPE_1>
La Lupe<n>I accept this wound, as a reminder of this failure. 
<R=LUPE_0>
La Lupe<n>But it will not happen again!
<R=LUPE_0>
La Lupe<n>Flee, child. Fight me again, and you will die.

La Lupe<n>This mercy, I offer you for correcting my underestimation of you Guildsmen.
<R=LUPE_0>
La Lupe<n>But know this!
<R=LUPE_0>
La Lupe<n>In return for this mercy, I shall see to it that five-hundred more of your fellow Guildsmen shall suffer.

La Lupe<n>If you wish to prevent that, challenge me again.
