Otenko<n>The cursed sunlight being given off by the [Eclipse] has allowed Dark Matter to sneak into places it could normally never reach under the Sun's light.
Otenko<n>Because of that, some [Sol Property] creatures have become aggressive during the Eclipse!
Otenko<n>Ivy is a [Sol Property] plant type monster that can regenerate itself.
Otenko<n>The only way to get rid of it is with a [Dark Property] attack.
