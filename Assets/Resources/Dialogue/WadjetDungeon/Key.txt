Obtained a [Δ KEY]!
S=AnnieHm
Annie<n>Hm...
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>This ain’t a normal key. It’s bein’ held together by dark magic.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>I’m astounded you managed to deduce that!
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Yes, this key is made by Immortal hands. If you leave the dungeon, it will evaporate into nothingness.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>Did you, uh, make it?
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>...You know what? I take it back.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Not my dungeon, not my key!
<L=ANNIE_4>
S=AnnieHeh
Annie<n>Ok then, so yer' an Immortal, right? Can't ya just make more keys for us to get through the locked doors?
<R=EMIL_6>
Emil<n>I-
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>You're surprisingly clever for a human.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>I try.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>But allow me to reiterate. Not. My. Dungeon. Not. My. Doors. One door, one key.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>...But it was a nice idea, I suppose.
