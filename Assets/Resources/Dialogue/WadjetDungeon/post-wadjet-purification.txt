Annie<n>...What the heck was that?!
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Hm, you'll have to elaborate, did you mean the part where I saved your hide, or-
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>The heart! What did you do to it?
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>That heart? I devoured it whole, and made it a part of me. 
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>And with nothing to cling to, La Lupe's chances of escaping death have been reduced to zero.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Yer not a crow, yer a good fer nothin’ vulture!
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>[Raven], thank you!
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>And perhaps if your so-called ''Pile Driver'' had been working like it had been supposed to, perhaps you could have finished her off more quickly!

Annie<n>The sigil was supposed to bind the Immortal to the coffin, but instead...
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>It won't be doing much of that.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>I'm not feeling any magic from those sigils, and these... ''reflectors'' look like they haven't been touched up in a century.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>I'm no expert, but I'm amazed they still work.

Emil<n>Wouldn't dream of it!

Emil<n>You see, I'm afraid our ''partnership'' isn't going to end just yet.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>The Immortal's dead. You said it yerself.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>Indeed I did. And what about it?
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Did you really think it was going to be that simple?
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>...Ya know something yer not tellin' me.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>A skillful observation.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Spill it, Vamp!
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Not just yet.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Something in the darkness may be listening. I'll explain everything once we're outside.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>...Maybe show some gratitude while you're at it.
