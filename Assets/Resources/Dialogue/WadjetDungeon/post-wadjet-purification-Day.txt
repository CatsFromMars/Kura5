Annie<n>Oi, yer still in one piece?
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>No singed feathers or nothin'?
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>Of course not.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Unlike some people I know, I don't operate recklessly.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Oi!
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Still, fine work for what is almost scrap!
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Your ''Pile Driver'' is looking pretty shoddy, isn't it?
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>I'm not feeling any magic from those sigils, and these... ''reflectors'' look like they haven't been touched up in a century.
<L=ANNIE_4>
Annie<n>It worked, didn't it? Immortal's purified!
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>Poof, into ash, dark matter and all.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Well, almost all of it. I had to do a little leg work myself to finish the job.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>Come again?
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>I just took a little bite of her heart for myself. Nothing much, but still enough to sustain me.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>The rest was burned to ashes, and I don't exactly fancy ash for a snack.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>Ain't that like cannibalism?
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Gross!
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Never eaten snake jerky before?
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>Ugh.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>Well, at least this way, between your efforts and mine, La Lupe is gone for good.

Emil<n>The adrenaline must be wearing off.

Emil<n>Don't go to pieces on me now.

Emil<n>You see, I'm afraid our ''partnership'' isn't going to end just yet.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>The Immortal's dead. You said it yerself.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>Indeed I did. And what about it?
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Did you really think it was going to be that simple?
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>...Ya know something yer not tellin' me.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>A skillful observation.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Spill it, Vamp!
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Not just yet.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Something in the darkness may be listening. I'll explain everything once we're outside.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>...Maybe show some gratitude while you're at it.
<L=ANNIE_4>
Annie<n>Good luck with that!
