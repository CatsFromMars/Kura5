Emil<n>Did you think it would be that simple?
Emil<n>Unfortunately for you, so long as that remains in the sky, the earth will remain in danger.
Emil<n>Luckily for you, there is a solution! 
Emil<n>Destroy the Immortals responsible for the Eclipse...
Emil<n>[Nightmare Clan...]
Annie<n>Nightmare Clan?

Emil<n>Immortals only kept in check by the powers that be- or rather, once were.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>You see, humanity thinks of Immortalkind as one family, but in actuality we exist in small [Clans] of like-minded individuals.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>The Immortals you are used to hunting are known as the Family of the Night, the [Vampires.]
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Then there are those who are not of this earth;<n>Death Clan, Shadow Clan, Demon Clan...All defeated by your kind in past battles.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>But with nothing to keep Nightmare Clan in check, they can do as they wish, without consequence!

Annie<n>''Without consequence'' my rear end!
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>They were literally waltzing over people's dead bodies earlier!
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>They can't just do whatever they want! Not if I can help it!
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Not if WE can help it.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Actually, what was it you called me earlier?
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>[''Partner...'']
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>You know, I think I could get used to that. [Partner!] It has a nice ring to it.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>Yeah? And what’s yer stake in this? What do you get if Nightmare Clan is gone?
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Death for death’s sake.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Believe me, we have the same murderous intentions, you and I. We would both see the Nightmare Clan turned to ash.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>But we cannot achieve our desires without borrowing each other's power...
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>S-so we'll do it then! Get rid of the Immortals, and that Eclipse goes away!
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Precisely!
<A=CutsceneFade_0>
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>Ok, I'll do it, but...You could be less of a jerk about it though.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>And you could be less impetuous.
