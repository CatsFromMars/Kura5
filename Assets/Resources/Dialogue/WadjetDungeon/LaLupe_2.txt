La Lupe<n>Well, don’t keep me waiting! Make your peace before we dance, yes?
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>Oh...Um...I-I came on behalf o' the Guild!
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Yer crimes against life on this star demand immediate action! This is yer only warning!
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>Cease your slaughter immediately or I-I'll have to r-resort to force...!
<R=LUPE_1>
La Lupe<n>'Cease my slaughter?' How will I eat, cazadora? You are asking me to starve!
<R=LUPE_0>
La Lupe<n>Hoho! Don’t look so blue, darling! I don't think of humans as all bad. Personally, I find your kind quite tasty!
<L=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Speaking of which, how was Flagstaff?
<R=LUPE_1>
La Lupe<n>Ah, that. I had just woken up after travelling from far away, and I was so hungry! 
<R=LUPE_1>
La Lupe<n>Why do you care? You are an Immortal, same as I. What worth to you is a few paltry lives?
<L=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>No need for the sudden defense! Why don't we leave judging the weight of a life to the Queen, hm? I know you're eager to start our dance.
<R=LUPE_0>
La Lupe<n>Ah! You two are so darling! I do love dinner and a show! Let's get started, shall we?
