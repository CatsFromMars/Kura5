Emil<n>Wait a second...

<CAM_GOTO_POINT=LookBok>
Emil<n>There it is. The most common Undead found anywhere in an Immortal's servitude, the [Ghoul], otherwise called a [Bok]. 
Emil<n>I'm sure you've seen them everywhere since the Eclipse began, and with good reason...They are easy to mass produce.
Emil<n>Living beings who die under the power of Dark Matter rise again as these mindless Undead, existing only to obey their masters.
Emil<n>Capable of patrol and hunting, but not much else. For the purposes of Immortals, that is more than enough.
<L=EMIL_2>
<CAM_GOTO_POINT=PlayerPositionContainer>
Emil<n>Outsmarting them is a simple task. Attacking them from behind while they aren't looking will give you the upper hand. 
<L=EMIL_4>
S=Hm
Emil<n>Alternatively, disposing of them head-on would be easy...Provided they were alone, anyway. 
<L=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>The [Klorofolun] they spit makes them no less deadly for being stupid. 
<L=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>They WILL overwhelm you if you're careless.
