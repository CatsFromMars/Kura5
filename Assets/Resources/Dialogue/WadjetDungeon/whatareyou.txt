Annie<n>S-so, I read there's different kinds o' Immortals, right? Vampires, Banshees, Dark Guardians...
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>I thought’chya were a Vampire, but you're not right 'batty' enough. What are ya?
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>While you're right in that I'm more than just a mere Vampire...
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>Wasn't it YOU who insisted that we know each other on a name only basis?
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>...Aye, so?
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Well, give me your title first. It's something along the lines of 'Solar Girl', right? 'Guildswoman' maybe?
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>Nuh-uh! I'm just called 'Annie'.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Then for all intents and purposes, I am just called 'Emil'.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>Why d'yer gotta talk in circles like that?!
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>Well-
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>That was a rhetorical question, don't answer it.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Why ask things you don't want answers to?
<L=ANNIE_3>
S=Annie_Grunt
Annie<n>AARGH! Fine, as far as I'm concerned, yer' just some weird bird Vampire!
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>You Immortals can change yer' shape anyway, can't ya? Never knew what the obsession with bats was.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>(...I feel like I should be offended, but I'm having way too much fun with this.)
