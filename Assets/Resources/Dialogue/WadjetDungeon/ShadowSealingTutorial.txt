<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>It's pretty dark in here.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Perfect! Perhaps now would be a good time to explain how [Shadow Sealing] works.
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>Messin’ with shadows? So that’s yer power...
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Of course! Immortals like myself have a greater control over Darkness than any mere undead ever will.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>So when the [LD Meter] reads that we’re standing in a shadow, I can make use of that Darkness to immobilize an enemy temporarily.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>All I need to do is strike an enemy with a [Dark Property] attack while standing in a shadow.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>The higher the [LD Meter] reading, the longer the effect lasts.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>But yer gunna need either [Sunlight] or [Moonlight] for a shadow to show up, right?
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Where light shines, shadows fall...
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Now that you are aware, have me make use of it as you will. Remember to press the [Space Bar] on the keyboard if you need my assistance.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>Yer gunna make it that easy?
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>If this is the beginning of any vampire funny business...
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Please. With all due respect Miss Annie, threatening language doesn't suit you in the slightest.
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>Instead, focus your efforts on the monsters in this room that need the Sun's 'mercy', hm?
<L=NULL_0>
<R=NULL_0>
To clear the trap, defeat all of the monsters!
