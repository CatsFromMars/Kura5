Annie<n>Another trap...
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Perfect! Perhaps now would be a good time to explain how [Shadow Sealing] works.
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>Ya gunna do to these monsters what ya did back before the Ivy showed up?
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Of course! Immortals like myself have a greater control over Darkness than any mere undead ever will.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>So when the [LD Meter] reads that we’re standing in a shadow, I can make use of that Darkness to immobilize an enemy temporarily.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>All I need to do is strike an enemy with a [Dark Property] attack while standing in a shadow.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>The higher the [LD Meter] reading, the longer the effect lasts.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>But yer gunna need either [Sunlight] or [Moonlight] for a shadow to show up, right?
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Where light shines, shadows fall...
