Annie<n>Don'tchya got any qualms about killing the monsters here?
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>I can't say that I do. Servants are like property. I might as well be smashing flowerpots.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Don'tchya have any sense o' duty toward yer own kind?!
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Hm? Are you implying I should devote my loyalty to the 'monsters' trying to kill you?
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>I mean...Immortals and the Undead...I thought you guys would be all friendly towards each other!
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>That'd be rather disadvantageous for you, don't you think? Ha ha ha!
