Annie<n>...
Emil<n>...Hello?
<A=AnniePlayer_11>
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>...Yeah?
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>You realize you can speak freely, yes?
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>I'll talk if somethin' comes up.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>What? Nothing to say at all? Nothing on your mind? Not even a comment? A quip?
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Anything to show there's something going on up there at all?
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>I would hope you were more than just a walking gun.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>I'd think a walkin' gun would be more useful for you shadowy types, wouldn't it?
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>You'd think that, but that's also dreadfully boring.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Even I would die of boredom if I had to occupy myself the whole way.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>...Oh! So that's what it is.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>You think if you talk, I'll find some way to try and manipulate you. Is that it?
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>You flatter me. 
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>But flattery only gets you so far with the undead, Solar Girl.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Hush! I ain't here to preen yer feathers, bird!
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>I'll be the judge of that.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie<n>Gah...
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>Can we keep movin'? Idle chatter ain't gonna kill the Immortal.
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>Are ya hoping we're gunna talk her to death?
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>I wouldn't rule it out, but you'd probably expire before we did.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>Mark that on my tombstone, I’m sure the guys n’ gals back home would get a good laugh out of it.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Hm, strange last request, but I’ll consider it.
