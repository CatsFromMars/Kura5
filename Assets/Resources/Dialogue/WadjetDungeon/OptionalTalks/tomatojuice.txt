Annie<n>How's that tomato juice taste?
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>Horrible!
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>R-really?
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>I guess I shouldn't be surprised...
<L=ANNIE_0> 
Annie<n>Back when I was a kid, they'd keep books with vampires kid-friendly by making them drink tomato juice.
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>I figured there was an ounce o' truth to that.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>And you'd be right.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>D-didn't yer just say you hated it?
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>I do! Don't get me wrong, I hate this... this taste.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Really, between the container and the preservatives, the taste has become even worse...
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>But for what I need... It'll get the job done.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>I imagine it's not common knowledge for humans, but for vampires, even things like a 'placebo effect' can exist, through means like this.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>...Oh!
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>So, because Tomato Juice is [red], yer body thinks yer really drinkin’ blood...
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Correct. The taste is dreadful, and it's horribly inefficient...
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>But it serves well enough to stifle my hunger, and keep me fed.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>I just wish I could do something about the flavor...
<L=ANNIE_4>
Annie<n>What if I got you a fresh tomato or something?
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>Don't push it. I'm only doing this so that I don’t have to drink YOUR blood.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>Gosh. Thanks.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>...Maybe I'll consider the tomato...
