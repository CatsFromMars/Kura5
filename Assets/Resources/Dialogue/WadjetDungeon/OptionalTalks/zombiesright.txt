Annie<n>...Hm...
<A=AnniePlayer_11>
<L=ANNIE_4>
Annie<n>How long've ya been watchin' me anyway?
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>Oh, not long. Only since I noticed you WEREN'T dying while making your way over here.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>. . .
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>Then you saw what happened to the other scouts?
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Oh yes. Their struggle was valiant, they handled the Undead swimmingly.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>But La Lupe... Well, she saw an end to that herself.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>But you! You survived. And you were even capable of hurting her, something your fellow Gunslingers weren't capable of.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>You've got something special, don't you?
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>I bet you even gunned down their [Ghouls], their very undead remains on your way to this place!
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>I couldn't have asked to encounter a better hunter.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>. . .
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>At least they went down fightin'. 
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>But if I had been here a bit sooner...
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Are you thinking you could have saved them?
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>I couldn't have known, I showed up here long after, but-
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>Maybe you could have. But that's neither here nor there.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>What you're here to do now, is kill La Lupe.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>If you're really so concerned your fallen comrades, your focus should be on avenging them.
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>That kind of thing tends to appeal to human sensibilities, doesn't it?
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>I think ya ought to stop talking about things ya know nothin' about.
