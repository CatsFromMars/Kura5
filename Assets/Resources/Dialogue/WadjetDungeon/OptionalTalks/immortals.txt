Annie<n>So...
<A=AnniePlayer_11>
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>Now that the Immortals are back, the Vampires might start stirring up more trouble than usual...
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>What's yer stance on this? Is it a big deal to you?
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>You sound so impressed. You must be tired of facing off with run of the mill Vampires if something like La Lupe impresses you.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>What any Immortal is capable of far surpasses that of a Vampire, and so many exist beyond this star.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>If something like La Lupe can leave you awed, you haven't seen anything yet. 
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>As for me... I'm not all that impressed.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>Yer not afraid?
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>I do not cower in fear of the name ''Immortal''. 
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil<n>For being descendants of the Vampire Lord, the Family of the Night has surprisingly little pride.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>At any rate, Immortal or not, the powers of darkness do my bidding.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>And now that the Sun is on my side, I won't lose, even to another Immortal.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>Is that why you're fighting them? For your pride?
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Believe what you'd like.
