Annie<n>Yer seem...Cheerful?
<R=Emil_2>
Emil<n>I'd hope so! After all, though I had my doubts before, I have found myself a human who is talented at what you call ''Euthanasia''.
<R=Emil_0>
Emil<n>After all, you had certainly put La Lupe out of her misery! Hahaha!
<R=Emil_3>
Emil<n>That shouldn't be terribly surprising, however...I can tell that Crimson Scarf you wear has been dyed with blood. But whose? Not yours.
<L=Annie_2>
Annie<n>My father gave me this scarf.
<L=Annie_1>
Annie<n>And his father before that...
<R=Emil_1>
Emil<n>A family heirloom? So you were bred for this kind of work.
<L=Annie_3>
Annie<n>'Scuse you?! We thought Immortals were gone for good a long time ago. I'm just doin' my job here...
<R=Emil_3>
Emil<n>Hm. Regardless of motive, the outcome is the same; that you're surprisingly good at it!
<L=Annie_2>
