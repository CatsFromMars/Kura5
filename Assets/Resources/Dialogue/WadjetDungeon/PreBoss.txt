Emil<n>I sense an Immortal up ahead- No, two of them.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie<n>There's two?!
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil<n>Well, three if you include me, but yes. I pray that doesn't change anything?
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>...
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>(If it comes down to it, can I take a three on one fight?)
<R=EMIL_0>
Emil<n>Hahaha! Your gun is shaking. Goodness, you're not backing down after coming this far, are you?
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil<n>Fearing death is only natural, however...
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie<n>No.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil<n>Then whatever it is you're feeling, beat it down and move forward.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil<n>It'd be shameful if your prey had to come to you themselves, after traversing this whole dungeon.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie<n>(Guess I got no choice, huh?)
<L=ANNIE_0>
Annie<n>(Even if it's raining cats and dogs, a sunflower holds its head up high!)
