La Lupe<n>Are you so arrogant to believe you can defeat me without the sun's power!?
Annie<n>(My timing was off...The generators won't run if there's no [sunlight]...!)

Emil<n>Unfortunately for you La Lupe, I am strongest in the dark as well.

Emil<n>Who else could it be?
Emil<n>Without [Sunlight], you cannot activate this Pile Driver...Normally, that is.
Emil<n>However, La Lupe has been sufficiently weakened, reduced to her core, her [heart]...
Emil<n>I can create a [seal] that will break apart her dark matter bit by bit!
Emil<n>When it's complete, shoot La Lupe into the seal. I'll take care of the rest.
Emil<n>But hurry when doing so. The seal can break if left unattended for too long...
Annie<n>...Okay!
Annie<n>Let's finish this!
