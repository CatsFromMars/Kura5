???<n>I already know.
Man in Green<n>He's back, isn't he?
???<n>I'm afraid so.
???<n>He's supposed to be removed from existence...Yet he's resurfaced.
???<n>He's even taken in a mayfly as a new plaything.
<A=Vinnell_4>
Man in Green<n>...I'll find him. I'll hunt him down and-!
<A=Violinist_2>
<A=Vinnell_5>
???<n>No. Do not offer him the convinience. Return home instead. 
???<n>In time, he will grow ravenous again and come for your heart.
???<n>But you would have spent time preparing for their arrival before then.
<A=Violinist_0>
???<n>Understood?
Man in Green<n>...Crystal clear.
???<n>[Von Linnell...]
???<n>I trust you do not mistake my caution for heartlessness.
???<n>But he knows you as well as I do.
???<n>You should understand what that means.
???<n>If you run off looking to become prey, he will gladly oblige you.
Von Linnell<n>...Yes, Boss.
