<R=EMIL_2>
Emil:<n>Perfect! Perhaps now would be a good time to explain how [Shadow Sealing] works.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie:<n>Messin’ with shadows? So that’s yer power...
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil:<n>Of course! Immortals like myself have a greater control over Darkness than any mere undead ever will.
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil:<n>So when the [LD Meter] reads that we’re standing in a shadow, I can make use of that Darkness to immobilize an enemy temporarily.
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil:<n>All I need to do is strike an enemy with a [Dark] property attack while standing in a shadow.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil:<n>The higher the [LD Meter] reading, the longer the effect lasts.
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie:<n>(That's pretty good!)
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie:<n>But yer gunna need either [Sunlight] or [Moonlight] for a shadow to show up.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil:<n>Where light shines, shadows fall...
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil:<n>Now that you are aware, have me make use of it as you will.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie:<n>How do I know yer aren't gonna use that on me, Vamp?
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil:<n>If I wanted to use it against you, I wouldn't have said anything at all.
<L=ANNIE_4>
Annie:<n>Yeah well...How about ya help me clear this trap, eh?
