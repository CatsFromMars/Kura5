Emil: You've been making quite a fuss here, blazing through the servants with that pistol of yours. Impressive!
Emil: But for as long as I've been observing, you never said a single word. I thought you deaf. Or mute! Or both.
<Annie raises her gun>
Annie: (That's an Immortal! A Vampire kinda Immortal, by the looks of it.)
Annie: (S'prolly gunna attack! Brace yerself!)
<Emil does nothing>
Emil: <...>
Annie: <...>
Emil: Are you going to shoot, or aren't you?
Annie: You're...Not gunna attack? 
Emil: Would you be willing to stay the Sun's wrath long enough to explain myself?
Annie: <...>
Annie: Fine. Make it quick like! 
Emil: Aha, see? It's obvious you are a Warrior of the Sun. You are willing to slaughter anything with Sol's opposite property, Dark.
Emil: And so you're pointing your Solar Gun, a tool that grants death to Immortals and the Undead, at me.
Annie: This ain't bein' quick.
Emil: But I know of the Immortal you seek. Her name is La Lupe, the Wadjet Immortal.
Annie: ...Aye?
Emil: I can take you to her, accompany you through her dungeon, but in exchange you must help me destroy her when the time comes.
Annie: Wha-?!
Annie: Ya don't mean you wanna help me fight the Immortal, do ya?!
Emil: You needn't repeat what I say. It's honestly not that hard to grasp.
Annie: Yer serious about this, ain'tchya? And what if I don't agree?!
Emil: Gosh, I hope your business here isn't terribly pressing then!
Emil: Because you will most likely die a painful death...And become Undead.
