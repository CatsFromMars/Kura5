<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie:<n>Yer...Not gunna attack? 
<R=EMIL_2>
Emil:<n>Would you be willing to stay the Sun's wrath long enough to explain myself?
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie:<n>Fine. Make it quick-like!
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil:<n>Aha, see? It's obvious you are a Warrior of the Sun. You are willing to slaughter anything with Sol's opposite property, Dark.
<R=EMIL_2>
And so you're pointing your <color=red>[SOLAR GUN]</color>, a tool that grants death to Immortals and the Undead, at me.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie:<n>This ain't bein' quick.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil:<n>But I know of the Immortal you seek.<n>Her name is La Lupe, the Wadjet Immortal.
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil:<n>I can take you to her, accompany you through her dungeon, but in exchange you must help me destroy her when the time comes.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie:<n>Wha-?!
<L=ANNIE_3>
Ya don't mean you wanna help me fight the Immortal, do ya?!
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil:<n>You needn't repeat what I say.<n>It's honestly not that hard to grasp.
<L=ANNIE_5>
Annie:<n>Yer serious about this, ain'tchya?<n>And what if I don't agree?!
<R=EMIL_3>
Emil:<n>Gosh, I hope your business here isn't terribly pressing then...
<R=EMIL_0>
Because you will most likely die a painful death...<n>And become Undead like those before you...
<L=ANNIE_2>
Annie:<n>. . .
Annie:<n>(I dunno what's goin' on, but I can't afford t'waste any more time! Best play along fer the time bein'.)
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie:<n>Awright, awright, just...keep the manipulatin' Vampire funny business to a minimum, and you can tag along.
<R=EMIL_6>
Emil:<n>...Interesting...Choice of words...<n>O loquacious Warrior of the Sun.
<L=ANNIE_1>
Annie:<n>Warrior of the Sun's somethin' you'd call my grandpa.
<L=ANNIE_4>
Annie:<n>If yer gunna work with me, call me Annie!
<R=EMIL_1>
Emil:<n>If you insist on a titleless introduction, my name is Emil.
<R=EMIL_5>
Emil:<n>Now that we are acquainted, we should be moving right along.
<L=ANNIE_3>
Annie:<n>Awright, but I’m warnin’ ya, Vampire! One fishy act an’ I burn yer to a crisp!
<R=EMIL_4>
Emil:<n>That’s the appropriate attitude!
