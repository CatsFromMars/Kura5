Emil<n>Do you want to know what I hate about this place the most? Something I cannot stand?
Emil<n>How narrow-minded you all are.
Emil<n>Everything on this earth never thinks beyond itself. 
Emil<n>Even spirits representing this earth's consciousness...Only care about the earth.
Emil<n>Is the rest of the Universe not worth protecting as well? Nobody here ever considers it.
Emil<n>Were you even aware the other stars have names? Do you know any of them?
Emil<n>No, for you it’s Sol, and only Sol. Never Sirius, Vulpecula, Arneb, Sadr...
Emil<n>Of course, those stars have long been conquered. Do you care?
Emil<n>You, and everyone else here, are so fortunate that I have something else to hate.
