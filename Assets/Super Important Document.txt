Congratulations! You have access to the game's files!
That wasn't so hard wasn't it? Heeheehee~

For Kura5 to exist in the way that it does, it's a free open source fangame
You are free to...
-Open the Unity Project and tinker with the files inside
-Release modified versions of the game
-Dissect this game for educational purposes

If you post files, all I ask is that you appropriately tag for spoilers. 
Please don't be a jerk and ruin the game for other people.

☀︎Finally, please have fun and "May the Sun be with you!"☀︎
